# Machine-Learning
The repository contains projects on based on different Machine Learning Algorithms.
The list of projects are given below.
# Housing Prices Prediction
The projecst aims at predicting sale price of houses with features like Lot Area,Zipcode and
Renovation Year to name a few.
Linear Regression was used in the project and all inportant preprocessing for a regrewssion 
model like Removal of multicolinearity, checking of variance inflation factor was done  
before applying the Linear Regression Algorithm. A high R squre score of 0.84 was 
achieved in the process.
